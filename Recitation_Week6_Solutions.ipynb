    "In functional programming style we tend to avoid loops and replace it with tail recursive functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another mechanism that we will study now is that of \"functors\" such as \"map\", \"filter\" and \"fold\". These functors allow us to manipulate Lists of objects. But they also apply to other data structures in scala such as Maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map: apply a function f to every element of a list.\n",
    "- Filter: keep just those elements of the list that satisfy a \"predicate\"\n",
    "- Fold (or reduce): perform an accumulative operation to every element of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look closer at these operations, let us first familiarize ourselves with anonymous functions in scala. Often it is cumbersome to define functions by name where we would like to pass a function. Therefore, we will use \"anonymous\" functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anonymous Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function which does not contain a name is known as an anonymous function. An anonymous function provides a lightweight function definition. It is useful when we want to create an inline function. Some Features of it-\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can write anonymous functions as little snippets of code\n",
    "- You can use them with methods on the List class like map and filter\n",
    "- With these little snippets of code and powerful methods like those, you can create a lot of functionality with very little code\n",
    "- \"=>\" is known as a transformer. The transformer is used to transform the parameter-list of the left-hand side of the symbol into a new result using the expression present on the right-hand side.\n",
